NikeITPersonasToSalesforce

# Description
NikeITPersonasToSalesforce is a Yeager Workflow component that is responsible for transforming the input data of Nike IT Personas into a format suitable for integrating with Salesforce. The component inherits from the AbstractWorkflow base class and implements the transform() method to process the input data and return the transformed output data.

  - `Success (bool)`: Indicates whether the transformation was successful or not.
  - `ErrorMessage (Optional[str])`: Detailed error message in case of a failed transformation.

# Parameters

4. Create an instance of NikeITPersonasToSalesforceOut with the extracted values and return it.
